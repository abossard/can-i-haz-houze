# Demo Mortgage Documents

These sample markdown files cover all required mortgage document categories:

1. Income verification (salary statement)
2. Credit report
3. Employment verification
4. Property appraisal

## Upload tips

- These files are text-based (`.md`) so `POST /documents/{id}/analyze` can read full content.
- The income sample is intentionally labeled **Salary Statement** to improve AI classification.
- During upload, include the suggested tags listed in each file so mortgage document verification passes reliably.
