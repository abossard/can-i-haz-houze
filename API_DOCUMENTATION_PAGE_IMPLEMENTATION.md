# API Documentation Page Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a new API Documentation page to the CanIHazHouze web UI that displays OpenAPI specification URLs and system prompts for each service. This page is designed to help users create AI agents in Azure AI Foundry.

## Changes Made

### 1. New API Documentation Page
**File**: `src/CanIHazHouze.Web/Components/Pages/ApiDocumentation.razor`

This Razor component provides:
- OpenAPI specification JSON URLs for all services (Mortgage, Document, Ledger, CRM)
- System prompts extracted from PROMPTS.md for the three main agents (Mortgage, Document, Ledger)
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for both URLs and system prompts
- Clean, card-based UI layout with color-coded sections for each service
- User-friendly instructions for creating AI agents with Azure AI Foundry

### 2. Navigation Menu Update
**File**: `src/CanIHazHouze.Web/Components/Layout/NavMenu.razor`

Added a new navigation link:
- Label: "ðŸ”Œ API Documentation"
- Route: `/api-docs`
- Icon: Plug icon (bi bi-plug)
- Position: After the Complaints link

## Features Implemented

### OpenAPI Specification Links
Each service displays its OpenAPI JSON endpoint URL:
- **Mortgage Service**: `https+http://mortgageapprover/openapi/v1.json`
- **Document Service**: `https+http://documentservice/openapi/v1.json`
- **Ledger Service**: `https+http://ledgerservice/openapi/v1.json`
- **CRM Service**: `https+http://crmservice/openapi/v1.json`

These URLs use Aspire service discovery format (`https+http://`) which automatically resolves to the correct service endpoint.

### System Prompts
System prompts are embedded directly in the page for three services:
1. **Mortgage Agent**: Complete prompt from PROMPTS.md with agent directives, data requirements, and approval logic
2. **Document Agent**: Full prompt including Base64 upload requirements, document types, and AI analysis guidelines
3. **Ledger Agent**: Complete prompt with account management features, transaction handling, and financial verification guidelines

The CRM service shows a placeholder message as no system prompt was defined in PROMPTS.md.

### Copy-to-Clipboard Functionality
Two JavaScript-based copy functions are implemented:
1. `CopyToClipboard(string text)`: Copies plain text (used for URLs)
2. `CopyTextareaToClipboard(string elementId)`: Copies content from a textarea element (used for system prompts)

Both functions use the browser's native `navigator.clipboard.writeText` API.

## UI Design

The page features:
- **Header Section**: Clear title and description with informational alert box
- **Service Cards**: Color-coded cards for each service:
  - Mortgage: Primary (blue)
  - Document: Info (light blue)
  - Ledger: Success (green)
  - CRM: Warning (yellow)
- **Input Groups**: Read-only text inputs with copy buttons for URLs
- **Textareas**: Multi-line, monospace text areas for system prompts with floating copy buttons
- **Instructions**: Step-by-step guide in a success alert box at the bottom

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Blazor Server**: For the Razor component
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive UI styling
- **Bootstrap Icons**: For visual icons
- **JavaScript Interop**: For clipboard operations via `IJSRuntime`

### Route
- Page route: `/api-docs`
- Accessible via the navigation menu

### Dependencies
- No new NuGet packages required
- Uses existing Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons already in the project
- Leverages standard Blazor component features

## Testing

### Build Verification
âœ… The Web project builds successfully without errors:
```
dotnet build src/CanIHazHouze.Web/CanIHazHouze.Web.csproj
Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
To verify the implementation works correctly in a running environment:

1. **Navigation**
   - [ ] Navigate to the API Documentation page from the menu
   - [ ] Verify the page loads without errors
   - [ ] Check that all four service sections are displayed

2. **OpenAPI URLs**
   - [ ] Verify each service shows the correct OpenAPI URL
   - [ ] Click each "Copy" button next to the URL fields
   - [ ] Paste to verify the URL was copied correctly

3. **System Prompts**
   - [ ] Verify the Mortgage, Document, and Ledger prompts are displayed
   - [ ] Check that the text is readable in the textarea
   - [ ] Click the "Copy" button on each system prompt textarea
   - [ ] Paste to verify the entire prompt was copied correctly

4. **UI/UX**
   - [ ] Verify the layout is responsive
   - [ ] Check that colors are applied correctly to each card
   - [ ] Ensure all icons display properly
   - [ ] Verify the instructions section is clear and helpful

## Usage Instructions

### For End Users
1. Navigate to "API Documentation" in the sidebar menu
2. Choose the service you want to create an agent for
3. Click "Copy" next to the OpenAPI Specification URL
4. Click "Copy" on the System Prompt section
5. Use these in Azure AI Foundry to configure your agent

### For Developers
To modify the page:
- Edit `ApiDocumentation.razor` to change the UI or add new services
- Update system prompts by modifying the string properties in the `@code` block
- Add new services by following the existing card pattern

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be made:
1. **Dynamic URL Generation**: Load OpenAPI URLs from configuration instead of hardcoding
2. **Toast Notifications**: Show a brief confirmation message when text is copied
3. **CRM System Prompt**: Add the CRM service system prompt when available
4. **Download Buttons**: Allow users to download prompts as text files
5. **Syntax Highlighting**: Add markdown rendering for better prompt readability
6. **Service Health Status**: Display whether each service is currently available
7. **OpenAPI Viewer**: Embed an interactive OpenAPI explorer (like Swagger UI)
